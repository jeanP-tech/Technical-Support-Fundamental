<h1>Networking</h1>
<h2>Basics of Networking</h2>

**network**: the interconnection of computers  
All of the computers linked together in a network.  
We can connects to an even bigger network, and on and on.  
Then, you've got billions of compters that are interconnected -> **the internet**  

Most people access the internet through a bowser.
This is done through the World Wide Web.
internet =/= World Wide Web

The internet: The physical connection of computers and wires around the world

The web: The information on the Internet.
world wide web is not only way you can access the Internet.
Email, chat, file-sharing programs..

Networking: Managing, building, and designing networks. 

The internet is composed of a massive network of satellites, cellular networks, and physical cables. 
servers connect directly to the internet.

Servers store the websites that we use.

The machines we use(mobile phone, video game...) are called clients.
**Clients** request the content like pictures, websites from the servers.
They don't connect directly to the Internet.
Instead, they connect to a network run by and Internet service provider.

Internet service provider(ISP)
Mac adresses: When you send or receive data through a network you need to have boh and IP and a MAC address

**Packets**: when we move data through the network, we break them down into packets


<h2>Language of the Internet</h2>  
**network protocol** Rules that make sure our packets are routed.
- efficiently  
- aren't corrupted  
- secure  
- right machine  
- named appropriately  


two protocols you need to know  
- Transmission Control Protocol - **TCP**
- Internet Protocol - **IP**

**IP** is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computer  
**TCP** handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another  
  important - it let us share information with other computer
