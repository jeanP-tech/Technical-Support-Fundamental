<h1>Networking</h1>
<h2>Basics of Networking</h2>

**network**: the interconnection of computers  
All of the computers linked together in a network.  
We can connects to an even bigger network, and on and on.  
Then, you've got billions of compters that are interconnected -> **the internet**  

Most people access the internet through a bowser.
This is done through the World Wide Web.
internet =/= World Wide Web

The internet: The physical connection of computers and wires around the world

The web: The information on the Internet.
world wide web is not only way you can access the Internet.
Email, chat, file-sharing programs..

Networking: Managing, building, and designing networks. 

The internet is composed of a massive network of satellites, cellular networks, and physical cables. 
servers connect directly to the internet.

Servers store the websites that we use.

The machines we use(mobile phone, video game...) are called clients.
**Clients** request the content like pictures, websites from the servers.
They don't connect directly to the Internet.
Instead, they connect to a network run by and Internet service provider.

Internet service provider(ISP)
Mac adresses: When you send or receive data through a network you need to have boh and IP and a MAC address

**Packets**: when we move data through the network, we break them down into packets


<h2>Language of the Internet</h2>  
network protocol Rules that make sure our packets are routed.

- efficiently
- aren't corrupted    
- secure    
- right machine    
- named appropriately    

two protocols you need to know  
- Transmission Control Protocol - **TCP**
- Internet Protocol - **IP**

**IP** is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computer  
**TCP** handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another  
  important - it let us share information with other computer

<h2>The Web</h2>

People access the Internet, through the Web.  
Websites are text documents that we format with HTML(hypertext markup language)  

When you navigate a website, you type a URL(Uniform Resource Locator) like www.reddit.com
- www: World Wide Web
- reedit.com: domain. website name.
- .com: type of website

IP address-172.217.6.46 maps to Google's homepage through  
**DNS(Domain Name System)**  
-acts like Internet's directory and lets us use human readable words to map to an IP address 

<h2>history of the Internet</h2>


- 1950s, the computers were huge and bulky.   
A programmer interact with these computers directly.

- Late 1960s, project DARPA.    
ealist version of internet ARPANET  
But problem- Networks couldn't talk each other.  
- 1970s, creatical breakthrough-TCP/IP  
people could send data to one another, but only text.
- 1990s,Tim invented the World Wide Web. 
It utilized different protocols for displaying information.

<h2>Limitations of the Internet</h2>

The current Protocol, **IPv4** consists of 32 bits separated into four groups.  
There are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses.  
but devices exceeded those numbers.  

**IPv6** addresses consist of a 128 bits.  
There are 2 to the 128 power possible IP addresses.  
  
**NAT(Network Address Translation)** lets organizations use one public IP address  
and many private IP addresses within the network.

<h2>Impact of the Ineternet</h2>

* Selling something
* entertainment
* TV 
* listening song (CD)
* news
* shopping 
* education

laptop & desktop -> mobile  
-amazing **technological age**


<h2>Internet of Things</h2>

More and more devices are being connected to the Internet.  
But, problem - cybersecurity or personal privacy  
  
What is the Internet of Things?  
It is increasingly being used to define objects that "**talk**" to each other.


<h2>Privacy and security</h2>
It is harder to maintain anonymity.  
ex) buying habits, posted information 
  
Governments' concern  
ex) Europe -COPPA(Childeren's Online Privacy Protection Act)
